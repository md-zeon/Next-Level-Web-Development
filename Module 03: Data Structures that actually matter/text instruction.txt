In this module, we dive into the core building blocks of logic and efficiency — the data structures that truly make a difference in how we think, code, and solve problems.



We’ll start by understanding the difference between stateless and stateful thinking, then revisit class constructors and methods to prepare for real-world implementations.



Next, you’ll get hands-on with Stacks, Queues, and the fascinating Linked List, learning how each one works, why they exist, and how they shape the performance of modern applications.



You’ll build data structures from scratch, explore how Nodes connect to form a Linked List, and implement essential methods like append(), prepend(), insert(), and remove() — finally using them to create a Queue powered by Linked List.
