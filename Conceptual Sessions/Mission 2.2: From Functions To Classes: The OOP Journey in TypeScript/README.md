# Mission 2.2: From Functions To Classes: The OOP Journey in TypeScript

Embark on a comprehensive Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) journey using TypeScript. Transition from functional programming paradigms to class-based design, mastering inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction in the context of TypeScript's powerful type system.

## Topics Covered

- Class definition and instantiation
- Inheritance and prototype chain
- Access modifiers and encapsulation
- Polymorphism and method overriding
- Abstract classes and interfaces
- Design patterns using OOP concepts

## Learning Objectives

- Understand OOP principles in TypeScript
- Build class-based components effectively
- Implement inheritance hierarchies
- Apply encapsulation and abstraction techniques
- Use TypeScript features to enhance OOP design
