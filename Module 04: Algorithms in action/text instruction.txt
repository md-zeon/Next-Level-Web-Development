It’s time to put your problem-solving mindset into motion!



In this module, you’ll move beyond theory and see algorithms come alive through real coding challenges.



We’ll start small — implementing a basic cache with Map and finding mutual friends using Set — before diving into logic-driven challenges like Valid Parentheses, Two Sum, and Palindrome Checker that test your thinking precision.



Then, we’ll explore the power of searching and sorting algorithms — from mastering Binary Search and understanding O(log n), to visualizing and implementing Selection Sort and Insertion Sort step by step.



By the end, you’ll not only know algorithms — you’ll understand how they think, how they optimize, and how they power every efficient system you’ll ever build.



This is where your logic meets action — and you start coding like a true problem solver. 💥
