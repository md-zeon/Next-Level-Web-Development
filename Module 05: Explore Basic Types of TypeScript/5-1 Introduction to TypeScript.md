# 5-1 Introduction to TypeScript

## Welcome to TypeScript!

TypeScript is a powerful programming language developed by Microsoft that builds on JavaScript by adding static type definitions. If you have a good understanding of JavaScript, TypeScript will become your superpower in web development.

### Why TypeScript?

- **Type Safety**: Catch errors at compile time rather than runtime
- **Better IDE Support**: Enhanced autocomplete, refactoring, and navigation
- **Improved Code Quality**: Self-documenting code with types
- **Scalability**: Easier to maintain and scale large codebases
- **JavaScript Compatibility**: All JavaScript code is valid TypeScript
